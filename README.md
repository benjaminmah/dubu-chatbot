# dubu-chatbot
A project focused on allowing businesses to create custom customer service chatbots with ease.

The name "dubu" comes from 두부, the Korean word for tofu. My vision is to create chatbots that can be easily customizable with features relevant to individual businesses, similar to how tofu can be combined with a plethora of ingredients in a wide array of recipes.

Each chatbot can be customized with simple tags for tone and read from a strict set of files to ensure reliable chatbot interactions.
